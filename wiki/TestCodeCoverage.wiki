= Introduction =

This page describes how you can get a report of code coverage in OSDE. We recommend that you use [http://www.eclemma.org/ EclEmma] for this task. Also, since test files are scattered around the host plug-in and the fragment project, this page also teaches you how to get reports from both of them.
