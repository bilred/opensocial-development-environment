   * Make a branch of the trunk
   * Checkout the branch, make your changes, and then commit your changes
   * Ask for code review of your changes in the branch
   * Once you get approval for your changes, merge your branch into the trunk and then commit

== Setup your development environment ==

  * Commit them to svn repository.

== Test your OSDE plugin during development ==

 * Please see:
 http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.pde.doc.user/guide/intro/pde_overview.htm

== Code Conventions ==

 * Sun's code conventions: http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html

 * indentation
   * please use 4-spaces and avoid using tabs.

 * javadoc
   * required for classes and public methods

 * unit test

== Code Review/Submit Guidelines ==

Please follow instructions at: http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/CodeReviews

Here are the detailed steps for contributing your changes/codes:
 # A developer creates a new branch with svn cp trunk branches/hot-new-stuff.
 # The developer writes, tests, and commits several changes to that branch.
 # The developer clicks "Request Code Review" and fills in the username of a teammate, a description of what the reviewer should look for, and the path to the branch.
 # The reviewer gets a regular issue notification email about the new code review issue.
 # The reviewer follows a link from the issue to the branch page and sees a summary of all the work that has been done on the branch and can view diffs.
 # The reviewer enters review comments, publishes them, and continues the discussion with the developer.
 # The developer may make additional changes to the code based on feedback from the reviewer.
 # When the reviewer is satisfied, he/she sets the review issue status to "Done" and the issue is closed.
 # The developer would then merge the work done on the branch into /trunk. 

Notes:

 * For people who want to contribute code but don't have submit privilege on OSDE's SVN server: please file a new issue of "review request" and attach your code as a SVN patch.
  * Please type in "/branches/patches" as the branch path when creating the new issue.
  * For reviewers: when the review request comes with a SVN patch, you have two ways to review the code:
    * Simply reply with comments in plain text.
    * Utilize the review feature provided by google code. In this case, the reviewer needs to commit the patch to a folder under /branches/contributor/feature/yyyymmddx/. Once the review is done, then the reviewer needs to merge the code into /trunk.

 * Your code for review should be placed under: /branches/your_name/your_feature/yyyymmddx/, where x might be your version number

== Understand the infrastructure of OSDE ==

 * *what each folder is used for? (To Be Done)*

 * *design doc for OSDE (To Be Done)*
