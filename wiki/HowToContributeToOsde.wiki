Here is a summary:
 # A developer creates a new branch with svn cp trunk branches/hot-new-stuff.
 # The developer writes, tests, and commits several changes to that branch.
 # The developer clicks "Request Code Review" and fills in the username of a teammate, a description of what the reviewer should look for, and the path to the branch.
 # The reviewer gets a regular issue notification email about the new code review issue.
 # The reviewer follows a link from the issue to the branch page and sees a summary of all the work that has been done on the branch and can view diffs.
 # The reviewer enters review comments, publishes them, and continues the discussion with the developer.
 # The developer may make additional changes to the code based on feedback from the reviewer.
 # When the reviewer is satisfied, he/she sets the review issue status to "Done" and the issue is closed.
 # The developer would then merge the work done on the branch into /trunk.
